            <p>
              Basecamp Supply started with a simple realization during a multi-day trek through the Grand Canyon. 
              Six miles into the descent, my gear began to fail – a broken strap here, a torn seam there. 
              By the time I reached the Colorado River, I'd jury-rigged half my equipment with paracord and duct tape.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              That trip changed everything. I spent the climb back out thinking about the gear we trust with our safety, 
              our comfort, our entire outdoor experience. Why settle for equipment that barely makes it through one adventure?
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Basecamp Supply was born from that frustration. We're not here to sell you the cheapest gear or the flashiest trends. 
              We're here to outfit you with equipment that earns your trust – tested on real trails, chosen by people who actually use it, 
              and backed by our commitment that if it's not good enough for our own adventures, we won't sell it to you.
